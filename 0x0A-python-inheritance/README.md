Inheritance
capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, and the class being inherited from is called a superclass or base class.

Inheritance provides code reusability and allows you to create specialized classes based on existing classes. The subclass inherits all the attributes and behaviors (methods) of the superclass, and it can also add its own attributes and behaviors or override the ones inherited from the superclass.

Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one superclass. This means that a class can have multiple parent classes, and it can inherit and combine their properties and behaviors.

In Python, multiple inheritance is achieved by specifying multiple base classes in the class definition. When a class has multiple parent classes, it can access attributes and methods from all of them.
